Septic Shock: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 1: Obtain medical history and perform clinical examination: An adult patient suspected of sepsis 
usually complains of Fever (usually >101°F [38°C]), chills, and rigors, Confusion, Anxiety, Difficulty 
breathing, Fatigue and malaise, Nausea and vomiting. Pallor or grayish or mottled skin are signs of 
poor tissue perfusion seen in septic shock. Petechiae or purpura might be be observed progressively 
over the whole body . If the patient is suffering from high fever there is a high risk of fungal infection. 
Hence elicit a history of immunosuppressant treatment, total parenteral nutrition, Neutropenia, 
previous long stay in ICU, severe renal failure, HIV infection, diabetes, previous Gastrointestinal 
surgery or organ transplant history  

Step 2: If suspected of Septic shock do the following things simultaneously 

A) Screen for Modified early warning score (MEWS) which includes heart rate, Blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, Axillary body temperature, mental status, urine output. 

B) Start the screening for infection to rule out noninfectious diseases example intracranial infarcts or 
hemorrhages, drug reaction   

C) Admit the patient to the ICU within 6 hours of admission/presentation 

D) Initiate continuous monitoring of Airway, Breathing and circulation simultaneously 

(i) Airway: High oxygen flow using oxygen mask or non invasive ventilation  

(ii) Breathing: Pulse oximeter 

(iii) Circulation: Insert central line/ large bore cannula and monitor mean arterial pressure  

Step 3: Obtain lab investigations, perform imaging studies to identify source of infection and measure 
S/lactate simultaneously 

(A) Lab investigations  : complete haemogram, liver function test including s. albumin, kidney 
function test, PT, INR, blood culture sampling or, brochoalveolar lavage sampling before the first 
intravenous systemic and empirical antibiotics 

(B) Imaging studies  : chest x ray, ultrasound abdomen, other as suggested from clinical examination 

(C) Serum lactate: >2mMol/L    

(D) Arterial blood gas analysis and venous blood gas analysis 

Step 4: Initiate Goal Directed Therapy and do the following things simultaneously.  

(A) Fluid Resuscitation: Start crystalloids preferably balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline as 
first choice (30ml/kg) over 30 mins   . Perform S Lactate every 30 mins   . Then check the following: 

(i) Patient is responsive: MBP > 65 mmHg and S lactate level starts falling to normal range, 

 
trend is important to note.  

 

(ii) Patient is not responsive: MBP < 65 mmHg. Do the following sequentially 

 

 
litres to bring MBP >mHg. If not responsive (MBP <65 mm Hg) move to next 

(a) Start Albumin 100ml to those who have received large volume of crystalloids >2 

(b) Start Norepinephrine: 0.03 units/mins. If not responsive (MBP <65 mm Hg)  stop 

 

 
norepinephrine move to next 

 

 
vasopressin and move to next 

 

 
dobutamine and move to next 

(c) Start Vasopressin: 0.25-0.5 ug/kg/min. If not responsive (MBP <65 mm Hg)  stop 

(d) Start Dobutamine: 3-20ug/kg/min. If not responsive (MBP <65 mm Hg) stop 

 

(e) Start Epinephrine: 0.01 to 20ug/kg/min. 

(B) Monitor BP: Using Central line to determine if MBP > 65 mmHg. If central line is not present 
consider peripheral lines with large bore starting from 18 G cannula  

(C) Ventilation: Use High Nasal Flow O2. Also do the following simultaneously. If the patients GCS is 
less than or Equal to 8, endotracheal intubation should be performed. 

(i) There is a high risk of ARDS in which the tidal volume is low (6ml/kg), at the same time 

 
there is high plateau pressure (30cmH2O). In these patients prone ventilation for >12 hours per day 
is recommended 

(ii) Also give intermittent NMBA   bolus, preferably Atracurium 0.1 to .2 mg per kg or Cis 

 
atracurium 0.01 mg per kg in consulation with the Intensivist . 

(D) Antimicrobial therapy to be started as per the following protocol: 

(i) If shock is present (MBP < 65 mm Hg) and sepsis is also present: Start antibiotics 

 
immediately.    pipirracillin tazobactum 4.5gm or base on the anatomical lesion suspected covering 
both gram positive and gram negative organisms for short duration 

(ii) If shock is absent (MBP > 65 mmHg) but sepsis is present: Start antibiotics immediately.   

 
pipirracillin tazobactum 4.5gm or base on the anatomical lesion suspected covering both gram 
positive and gram negative organisms for short duration 

(iii) If shock present and sepsis is not yet diagnosed: Start antibiotics immediately.   

 
piperricillin tazobactum 4.5 gm OR ceftrizone 1gm OR meropenem 500 mg 

(iv) If shock absence and sepsis is not yet diagnosed: Hold on to administer antibiotics but 

 
start immediately if concern persists 

(E) Start antifungal therapy   if patient has high risk of fungal infection has been identified based on 
history. Injection flucanazole 200 mg

(F) General Measures to be performed simultaneously: 

(i) Regular blood sugar testing   (144-180 mg/dL) done from arterial blood sample or bed side 

 
capillary blood sample from central laboratory. Start insulin therapy   if > 180 mg/dL 1unit/kg and 
adjust with blood sugar levels 

(ii) If hemoglobin is below 7gm/dL: perform blood transfusion   

(iii) Consider corticosteroids 50 mg intravenous thrice daily  

(iv) If there is Acute Kidney injury (oliguria say less 1ml/kg and high creatinine value) (How do you 
diagnose this  ) initiate continuous or intermittent renal replacement therapy by intermittent dialysis   

(v) Monitor pH level. If pH <7.2   it is metabolic acidosis alongwith Acute Kidney injury start 

(vi) It is recommended that oral nutrition is started immediately within 72 hours of 

 
Bicarbonate therapy (dose ) 

 
admission
